We will do this by evaluating marine ecosystem model simulations against observational data (Rynne et al. 2024). Provided the models can detect observed changes adequately, we then aim to gain a better understanding of the primary causes of these changes through sensitivity experiments (attribution).\nThis information will allow FishMIP to better target policy initiatives such as IPCC and IPBES by providing more robust uncertainty assessment, as well as advancing the state of FishMIP models for informing vulnerability, impact, and adaptation plans of coastal sea ecosystems and fisheries (requested by the FAO). It will also help move towards a detection and attribution framework.\nThe focus of studies produced from this simulation round will be a significant advance in at least two ways:\n\nforcing models with higher spatial resolution of global climate models and reconstructed historical fishing effort and\nassessment of models against reconstructed historical catches (as well as biomass and other fisheries and ecological metrics in regions where additional data are available).\n\nThis protocol is designed to contribute directly to the ISIMIP 3a Simulation Round on “Evaluation, Detection and Attribution”.\nRevised target date for uploading simulation outputs: Nov 30th, 2024\n\nUploading simulations by this date is essential to ensure enough time for analysis and writing of manuscripts in time for submission to the Special Issue. If you are able to upload results sooner, that would be helpful. If you need more time, please let us know as soon as possible.\nProgress towards this deadline will be supported and facilitated through online global and regional modeller workshops to:\n\nEnsure correct ESM model inputs and access\nEnsure fishing drivers work (separate global and regional breakaway groups)\nTool sharing & troubleshooting\nCheck model outputs/issues\n\nIn this document we describe the general experimental and scenario set-up (Section 3). Further down in Section 4 we include the details of the specific input variables that modellers can use to implement scenarios. In Section 5 we describe the set of outputs to be created. Finally in Sections 6-7 we provide further notes and instructions on how to report and upload model results.\nFurther information on this protocol can be found here:\nhttps://protocol.isimip.org/#ISIMIP3a/marine-fishery_regional/marine-fishery_global\nFor this simulation round, we are asking you to run and upload 2 core runs, 2 optional (but preferred) detection and attribution runs, and 2 optional (but helpful) sensitivity test runs, described below.\n\n\n\nEach model experiment is a set of model simulations that has a particular goal (e.g. model evaluation). A scenario is a particular setting for forcing drivers that describes how each model run should be set up in the experiment, including both the type of climate forcing (CF) and the type of direct human forcing (DHF), in particular fishing.\nThe model runs that we are requesting for this simulation round are listed below. Please prioritize the core runs below, and provide the ‘optional’ if possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment\nScenario description\nScenario specifier\nSensitivity specifier\n\n\n\n\nModel evaluation\n2 core runs\n1.Climate, river inputs, fishing – high res\n\nCF: Climate variability constrained by reanalysis atmospheric forcing (GFDL-COBALT2 forced by JRA-55 and river inputs) using 0.25 degree grid\nDHF: Varying direct human influences according to observed reconstructed fishing effort time series (histsoc).\n\nobsclim\nhistsoc\ndefault\n\n\n\n2.Climate, river inputs, no fishing – high res\n\nCF:  same as above using 0.25 degree grid\nDHF: without any fishing activity (nat)\n\nobsclim\nnat\ndefault\n\n\nRiverine influx sensitivity\n2 optional (but preferred) runs\n3.Climate, no river input forcing, fishing – high res\n\nCF: Climate variability constrained by reanalysis atmospheric forcing (GFDL-COBALT2 “control run” only forced by JRA-55) using 0.25 degree grid\nDHF: Varying direct human influences according to observed reconstructed fishing effort time series (histsoc).\n\nobsclim\nhistsoc\n1955-riverine-input\n\n\n\n4.Climate, no river input forcing, no fishing – high res\n\nCF:  same as above using 0.25 degree grid\nDHF: without any fishing activity (nat)\n\nobsclim\nnat\n1955-riverine-input\n\n\nResolution sensitivity test\n2 optional (but helpful )runs\n5.Climate, river input forcing, fishing – low res\n\nCF: Climate variability constrained by reanalysis atmospheric forcing (GFDL-COBALT2 forced by JRA-55 and river inputs obsclim) using 1 degree grid\nDHF: Varying direct human influences according to observed reconstructed fishing effort time series (histsoc).\n\nobsclim\nhistsoc\n60arcmin\n\n\n\n6.Climate, river input forcing, no fishing – low res\n\nCF:  same as above using 1 degree grid\nDHF: without any fishing activity (nat)\n\nobsclim\nnat\n60arcmin\n\n\nControl sensitivity test\n2 optional runs\n7.Climate, no river input forcing, fishing – low res\n\nCF: Climate variability constrained by reanalysis atmospheric forcing (GFDL-COBALT2 forced by JRA-55 and river inputs obsclim) using 1 degree grid\nDHF: Varying direct human influences according to observed reconstructed fishing effort time series (histsoc).\n\nobsclim\nhistsoc\n1955-riverine-input+60arcmin\n\n\n\n8.Climate, no river input forcing, no fishing – low res\n\nCF:  same as above using 1 degree grid\nDHF: without any fishing activity (nat)\n\nobsclim\nnat\n1955-riverine-input+60arcmin\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe focal historical period for this model evaluation experiment spans 1961-2010. To capture the transition from a pre-industrial spin-up to 1961 we also provide input for a gradual increase in fishing and environmental variability for the pre-industrial period to 1961.\n\nFor fishing effort prior to 1961, we provide input for a nominal spin-up (1841-1860, fishing held constant at 1861 levels) and pre-industrial transition period (1861-1960, reconstructed fishing effort).\n\nTo set-up climate-forcing variables for the entire 1841-1960 period, we ask modellers to use the “control run” (ctrlclim) monthly output for the years 1961-1980 (inclusive) on repeat for six cycles. These years have been selected because they correspond with an entire ENSO cycle and because no climate trend is detectable prior to 1980 from the GFDL model.\n\nFor models that require longer spin-up prior to 1841, please keep 1841 levels of fishing effort constant and, if needed, repeat the ENSO cycle (e.g. monthly values for 1961-1980 inclusive from ctrlclim) for as many times necessary.\n\nFor the ‘no fishing’ runs (nat), the spin-up and pre-industrial transition should not use any fishing effort.\n\nWe ask modellers to include all outputs from 1841 onwards for use in our evaluation assessment of model drift. Each output should be saved as two files, the first covering the spin-up and transition period (1841-1960) and the second covering the historical (experiment) period (1961-2010).\n\n\n\nThroughout the protocol we use ‘specifiers’ that are shortened names used to denote a particular scenario, variables, or other parameter in the filenames of model inputs and outputs. It is crucial that you also use the same specifiers in your output files.\n\nCorrect formatting and naming of output files are essential for model intercomparison and analysis.\n\nTables 2-4 describe the different scenarios for the model runs described in Table 1. These specifiers are used in the file names of the corresponding input files and should also be used for the names of the output files (see  7.

This can be achieved using different approaches such as a simple gravity model – e.g. see Coll et al. 2020 but details will depend on model structure.\nWe are developing a simplified worked example for global modellers to explore and contribute to. This will be made available on github/FishMIP in due course.\nWhile we recommend using the above spatially aggregated effort, for global models that cannot technically carry out spatial allocation of effort, gridded total industrial and artisanal nominal active effort have been provided in the same folder as the file above and are saved as netcdf files. These can be allocated to functional groups (e.g. according to relative biomass) depending on model structure.\n\n\n\nDownscaling of the above fishing effort to match regional model inputs is likely to be needed. We request that regional modellers work together in their specific regions to ensure we have clear and common methodologies.\nWe are developing a worked example for regional modellers to explore and contribute to for their region which will be made available on github/FishMIP in due course.\n\n\n\nModellers are permitted to calibrate or tune their models using historical fisheries catch data (that will also be used for model evaluation) on the condition that only years up to and including 2004 are used in model calibration/tuning.\nModelling groups must keep detailed documentation on how their model was calibrated (e.g. input forcing, calibration data, time domain, spatial domain, fish grouping (size, functional types, total), optimization metric(s), weighting schemes, etc.) to be included in manuscript methods. Written description of sources of calibration data and methods used need to be provided with all simulation outputs. A template will be provided for this documentation in due course.\nThe fisheries catch data .csv file that can be used for model calibration is here:\nlevante:/work/bb0820/ISIMIP/ISIMIP3a/InputData/socioeconomic/fishing/histsoc/catch-validation_isimip3a_histsoc_1850_2004.csv.\nThe fisheries catch data are already aggregated into the functional groups and spatial zones as the above effort forcing data.

Please contact regional FishMIP coordinators for more information.\nAs a first step, regional modellers will need to provide shapefiles for their respective model domains for us to help with spatial extraction of the above global climate and fishing effort forcing inputs.\nRegion-specific climate forcing variables will be made available here:\n/work/bb0820/ISIMIP/ISIMIP3a/InputData/climate/ocean/<obsclim> or <ctrlclim>/regional/\nA .csv file with fishing effort extracted for regional model ecosystems is also available in the same folder as the global fishing effort data (../fishing/histsoc), for regional models that have provided shapefiles.\nRegional modellers may wish to make their raw unaggregated output available for more detailed analyses, including for example, a wider range of functional groups/size classes/species and ecosystem indicators. Please discuss this with FishMIP regional coordinators before uploading files.\n\n\n\nThe specification on how to submit the data, as well as further information and instructions are given on the ISIMIP website at:\nhttps://www.isimip.org/protocol/preparing-simulation-files\nIt is important that you comply precisely with the formatting specified there, to facilitate the analysis of your simulation results in the ISIMIP framework. Incorrect formatting can seriously delay analyses. The ISIMIP Team will be glad to assist with the preparation of these files if necessary.\nFile names consist of a series of identifier, separated by underscores. Things to note:\n\nReport one variable per file.\nIn filenames, use lowercase letters only.\nUse underscore (_) to separate identifiers.\nVariable names consist of a single word without hyphens or underscores.\nUse hyphens (-) to separate strings within an identifier, e.g. in a model name.\nData model is NETCDF4_CLASSIC with minimum compression level of 5.\nNetCDF file extension is .nc.\nThe relative time axis’ reference date is days since 1841-1-1 00:00:00 if the output covers the spin-up and transition period (1841-1960) or days since 1901-1-1 00:00:00 if the output covers the experiment period (1961-2010). We have provided .csv files to be used for the time dimension in creating NetCDF files based on the 365 days calendar. Please see time_axix_spinup.csv and time_axis_experiment.csv in this repository. The script time_axis.r was used to create these files.\n\n\n\nPlease name the files in the Fisheries and Marine Ecosystems sector according to the following pattern:\nGlobal models\n<model>_<climate-forcing>_<bias-adjustment>_<climate-scenario>_<soc-scenario>_<sens-scenario>_<variable>_<global>_<time-step>_<start-year>_<end-year>.nc\nExample:\nboats_gfdl-mom6_cobalt2_none_obsclim_histsoc_default_tcb_global_monthly_1961_2010.nc\nRegional models\n<model>_<climate-forcing>_<bias-adjustment>_<climate-scenario>_<soc-scenario>_<sens-scenario>_<variable>_<region>_<time-step>_<start-year>_<end-year>.nc\nExample:\nosmose_gfdl-mom6_cobalt2_none_obsclim_histsoc_default_tcb_benguela_monthly_1961_2010.nc\nPlease see the climate-scenario, soc-scenario, sens-scenario and variable identifiers given in the tables of this document.\n\n\n\nGlobal models\nThe output files covering the spin-up period (1841-1960) can be saved on DKRZ here:\n/work/bb0820/ISIMIP/ISIMIP3a/UploadArea/marine-fishery_global/model_name/temp2\nThe output files covering the experiment period (1961-2010) can be saved on DKRZ here\n/work/bb0820/ISIMIP/ISIMIP3a/UploadArea/marine-fishery_global/model_name/temp\nRegional models\nThe output files covering the spin-up period (1841-1960) can be saved on DKRZ here:\n/work/bb0820/ISIMIP/ISIMIP3a/UploadArea/marine-fishery_regional/model_name/temp2\nThe output files covering the experiment period (1961-2010) can be saved on DKRZ here\n/work/bb0820/ISIMIP/ISIMIP3a/UploadArea/marine-fishery_regional/model_name/temp\nPlease contact FishMIP coordinators (fishmip.coordinators@gmail.com) or ISIMIP data managers directly (isimip-data@pik‐potsdam.de) if you have any questions or clarifications before submitting files or if you do not find your model’s path on DKRZ as described above.\nPlease contact FishMIP coordinators if you would like to participate in this simulation round but have encountered issues with any aspect of the protocol.\n(For fishing): please provide all assumptions about catchability, technological creep, and model calibration.\nPlease provide any conversion factors that you have used to convert units.\n\n\n\nFishMIP is entirely community-driven, and we appreciate the effort of all involved."
